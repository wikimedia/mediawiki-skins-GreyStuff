# GreyStuff
GreyStuff is a fixed-width grey skin intended to emphasise content over interface stuff, initially created in an attempt to write a skin in an hour. Obviously the attempt failed, but the skin was eventually written regardless.
It was originally called 'LookMumASkin'. The name has only slightly improved since then.
It mostly supports mobile with full tools (mileage may vary on how pleasant their interfaces become at mobile sizes).
